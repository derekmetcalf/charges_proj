    "## Machine-Learning Atomic Charges for Efficient Molecular Dynamics Simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "Partitioning the electron density of a molecule (or collection of molecules)\n",
    "is of fundamental importance in simulating molecular motion using molecular\n",
    "dynamics. Traditionally, partitioning the electron density requires a \n",
    "relatively expensive wavefunction or density functional theory (DFT) calculation,\n",
    "methods that formally scale as at least $\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$. By contrast, the underlying\n",
    "molecular dynamics scales approximately as $\\mathcal{O}(N)$, making the DFT the\n",
    "rate-limiting step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we construct an empirical model of atomic charge partitioning with\n",
    "asymptotic $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ cost, reducing the formal scaling of the entire method\n",
    "by $\\mathcal{O}(N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, we map an atom in its environment to a corresponding\n",
    "scalar, its atomic charge. The atomic charge label is computed by the minimal\n",
    "basis iterative stockholder (MBIS) algorithm performed on a second-order\n",
    "perturbative wavefunction from the simplest truncation of symmetry-adapted\n",
    "perturbation theory (SAPT0).\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. We seek the function that maps the atomic environment ($\\vec{X}$) to its\n",
    "corresponding atomic charge ($y$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec{X} \\leftarrow y$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, choosing $\\vec{X}$ (Coulomb matrices, symmetry functions, graph convolutions),\n",
    "and an appropriate functional form (KRR, k-NN, MLP) are critical in achieving\n",
    "a sufficiently fast and physically meaningful mapping."

    "Now, we'll define a couple options for $\\vec{X}$, our \"atomic environment vectors\" -- the (local) Coulomb matrix and symmetry functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Coulomb matrix is defined as\n",
    "$$C_{ij} =\n",
    "      \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll}\n",
    "          \\frac{Z_i Z_j}{r_{ij}}& i \\neq j \\\\\n",
    "          Z_i^2 & i = j\n",
    "      \\end{array} \\right.$$\n",
    "The local version of the Coulomb matrix, used for efficiency and constant vector sizes, only considers the nearest $n$ $j$ in Euclidian distance. The matrix is flattened and fed as input to any statistical algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The radial symmetry function is defined as \n",
    "$$G_{i}^{rad}(\\mu, \\eta, Z) = \\sum_{j \\ne i}e^{-\\eta(r_{ij}-\\mu)^2}f_{c}(r_{ij})\\delta_{ZZ_{j}},$$ with cutoff function $f_c(r_{ij})$ to enforce locality, $$f_{c}(r_{ij})=\n",
    "      \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll}\n",
    "          \\frac{1}{2}(\\cos(\\frac{r_{ij}}{r_c}) + 1) & r_{ij}\\leq r_c \\\\\n",
    "          0 & r_{ij} > r_c\n",
    "      \\end{array} \\right. ,$$\n",
    "and $\\delta_{ZZ_{j}}$ is the Kronecker delta, enforcing different \"channels\" for different nearby nuclei.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these have options, which can be seen as hyperparameters. For the local Coulomb matrix, $n$ decides how many atomic neighbors are considered. The symmetry functions, which are simply a set of radial Gaussian shells, have an $\\eta$ parameter, determining the width of each Gaussian, $\\mu$, determining the offset of each gaussian from the origin atom, and $r_c$, the cutoff distance. In practice, $r_c$ rarely exceeds $5$ angstroms, $\\mu$ is evenly spaced between a small number ($0.5$ angstroms, or so) and $r_c$, and $\\eta$ is treated as a true hyperparameter."
